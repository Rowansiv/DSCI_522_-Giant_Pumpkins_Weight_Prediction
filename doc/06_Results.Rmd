# Results and Discussion

Initially, to determine which features would be useful in predicting pumpkin
weight, we plotted distributions of pumpkin weights and each feature.

```{r feature-distributions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Comparison of distributions of pumpkin weights and features.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("..src/eda/results/correlation.png")
```

- Conclusion

We tuned the hyperparameters of the Ridge model and found the most effective
parameter to be _______. In doing so, we were able to achieve a cross validation
score of _______.

```{r hyperparameter_tuning, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2. Hyperparameter Tuning for Ridge($\alpha$", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("..src/eda/results/_______.png")
```

Our prediction model performed decently well on the test data ______

Finally, during our EDA, we were able to create a more accurate model to
predict weights of giant pumpkins but have opted to use the Ridge model instead. 
We have chosen to do so as the _____ model required upwards of 5 hours to run 
which we believe to be impractical and as such have decided to use a slightly less
accurate but much faster model.
