# Summary


This project is an attempt to build a prediction model to estimate the weight of giant pumpkins based on their features
such as year of cultivation, place and over the top(ott) size, in order to predict the next year's winner of the GP 
competition. We used the ridge model as our final model which performed fairly well on our unseen test data set. To further optimise the model, we have tuned the hyperparameter of this model ($\alpha$). The core on cross validation sets is `python round(cv_scores,1)` and the test score is `python round(score, 1)`. Based on this model, the most coefficient feature is ... . We tested other models such as random forest that performed better on the test data. However, the drawback of this model is its fit time. Therefore, for the purpose of reproducibility, we decided to utilise the ridge model. In the future if you more precise results are required we recommend the use of other models.
