## Analysis
The majority of the raw data is composed of features with the character data type 
where some of the features such as 'country' or 'city' contain information relating
to the origin of the pumpkin and where it was grown whilst others are numeric such as
the year the pumpkin was grown.We have chosen features that we believe may 
impact the weight of a pumpkin whilst dropping other features that we deem
irrelevant. An initial data cleaning, preparation and pre-processing was required to 
ready the data for training purposes. The dataset was split with a 70/30 split
for the training and test sets respectively along with random seeding for 
reproducibility. 
  
  
  
For the numeric features, we used a simple imputer to insert the 'mean' value
for any missing or Null values as well as a standard scaler via a pipeline. For
categorical features, we similarly used a simple imputer but instead of filling
in values with the mean, we filled them in with the value 'missing'. We then used
one hot encoding to further evaluate each feature.
  
  
  
The Ridge model was used to build and predict the weight (lbs) of a giant pumpkin
given certain features from the dataset. The model was created using the train dataset,
combined with the features we spoke about earlier, and the actual given weights
of particular giant pumpkins.
