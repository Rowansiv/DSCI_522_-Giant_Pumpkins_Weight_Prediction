## Contributing
This document outlines how to propose changes to the Giant Pumpkin project.

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.

### Prerequisites

Before submitting a pull request, please propose the change in the "Issues" section
for other contributors to assess whether or not a change is required.
If a bug is found, create an issue and describe the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull Request Process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR). 
*  All new code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or
   PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
