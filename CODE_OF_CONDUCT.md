# Code of Conduct

## Our Community

We ask that our community and users of this repo conduct themselves in a respectful, professional, open, and considerate manner.
We recognise that by having an open community such as this, we are more able to foster continued growth and generate new ideas as a result of each contributor's
personal experience and diverse backgrounds.

We are aiming to create a safe environment where users can freely contribute their ideas and receive feedback. We wish to provide a space where people can come
to further their learning and assist others in their data science journey.
